			<h2>Task 1: Drawing Single-Color Triangles</h2>
			To rasterize triangles, I calculate A, B, and C of the line equation (L(x,y) = Ax + By + C) of the three lines of the triangle (P0->P1, P1->P2, P2->P0).
			Then, I evaluate these three line equations for each point in the bounding box of the triangle, filling the pixel if all of the line equations are >= 0 or <= 0.
			I check that they're either >= 0 or <= 0 in order to make winding order irrelevant because going a different direction just flips the sign. This doesn't fill additional pixels because the line equations only satisfy this condition when the point is inside the triangle.

			This algorithm is no worse than one that checks each sample in the bounding box of the triangle since it just checks each sample in the bounding box.
